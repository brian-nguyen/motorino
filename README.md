# Best Buy's Lowest Price Guarantee
Bizhacks 2018    

Customers need an automated system in which they can submit their Lowest Price Guarantee requests up front, where it’s on the customer to provide the proof (either via competitor product URL, or Image of flyer, etc.). The system would verify the competitor’s product, price and qualifications and then apply the Price-Beat if it meets all requirements. If not, clearly indicate to the customer why it doesn’t qualify. This could also flag these price-beat request to the merchants to adjust with vendors as necessary.
